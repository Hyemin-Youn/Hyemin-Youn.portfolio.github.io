        Hello! I am Hyemin Youn, a double major in Political Science & Diplomacy and IT Information Engineering at Chonbuk National University. I am passionate about development and continuously growing through various projects.

        After completing a Database course in the spring semester of 2024, I attended the Big Data Job Bootcamp in July. There, I gained hands-on experience with databases and developed a dream of becoming a DBA. I am committed to studying ERD, MongoDB, RDBMS, and NoSQL.
